        mercury: "Mercury experiences the most extreme temperature fluctuations in the solar system, ranging from -173°C (-280°F) at night to 427°C (800°F) during the day. A single day on Mercury (one full rotation) takes 59 Earth days, while a year (one orbit around the Sun) takes just 88 Earth days. This swift orbit around the Sun led to its naming after the Roman messenger god, Mercury. Despite being the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the hottest.",
        venus: "Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets, causing the Sun to rise in the west and set in the east. It is the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 471°C (880°F). A day on Venus (one full rotation) is longer than its year; it takes about 243 Earth days to rotate once, but only 225 Earth days to orbit the Sun. The thick atmosphere of Venus is primarily composed of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making it inhospitable to life as we know it.",
        earth: "Earth is the only known planet to have stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, essential for supporting life. It is the only planet known to support a diverse array of life forms, from microorganisms to complex plants and animals.

The planet's unique position and conditions in the solar system make it a perfect habitat for millions of species.",
        mars: "Mars, known as the red planet due to its iron oxide-rich soil, is home to the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands about 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) high. It has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids. Mars has the largest dust storms in the solar system, sometimes covering the entire planet for months. Scientists believe Mars once had liquid water and is a primary candidate for finding signs of past life.",
        jupiter: "Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and has a massive storm called the Great Red Spot, which has been raging for at least 400 years and is about twice the size of Earth. It has 79 known moons, the most of any planet, including Ganymede, the largest moon, which is bigger than Mercury. Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet, 14 times stronger than Earth's. Its atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with colorful bands and spots created by strong winds and chemical reactions.",
        saturn: "Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, composed of ice, rock, and dust particles, making it the most visually striking planet. Despite its large size, Saturn has the lowest density of any planet; it would float if placed in a large enough body of water. Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is bigger than Mercury and has a thick atmosphere with lakes of liquid methane. The planet's rings are divided into seven groups, each named alphabetically in the order of their discovery.",
        uranus: "Uranus is unique among the planets due to its extreme axial tilt of 98 degrees, causing it to orbit the Sun on its side. It is the coldest planet in the solar system, with temperatures dropping as low as -224°C (-371°F). Uranus has faint rings and 27 known moons, with names mostly derived from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Its blue-green color comes from methane gas in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue.",
        neptune: "Neptune has the fastest winds in the solar system, with speeds reaching over 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). The planet is known for its Great Dark Spot, a storm comparable to Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, roughly the size of Earth. Neptune appears blue due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It has 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest, exhibiting geysers that spew nitrogen gas.",
    
        moon: "The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, influences tides due to its gravitational pull and experiences moonquakes similar to earthquakes on Earth. Its surface is marked by craters and maria, dark basaltic plains formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth at a rate of about 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) per year. It has no atmosphere, resulting in extreme temperature variations between its day and night.",
        phobos: "Phobos, the larger of Mars’ two moons, is gradually spiraling inward and will either crash into Mars or break up to form a ring in about 50 million years. It is heavily cratered and has grooves on its surface. Phobos orbits Mars three times a day, making it one of the fastest-moving moons in the solar system. Its irregular shape and close orbit to Mars make it a fascinating object for study.",
        deimos: "Deimos, the smaller of Mars’ two moons, is thought to be a captured asteroid like its counterpart, Phobos. It is covered in a thick layer of dust and loose rock, making its surface smoother than Phobos. Deimos takes approximately 30 hours to orbit Mars and is slowly moving away from the planet. Its name, meaning 'terror,' complements Phobos, which means 'fear,' reflecting the moons' mythological origins.",
        europa: "Europa, one of Jupiter’s largest moons, has a smooth, icy surface with a possibility of an ocean beneath it, making it a prime candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life. Its surface is crisscrossed by fractures and lines, indicating a dynamic and possibly habitable environment beneath. Europa experiences tidal heating due to its gravitational interaction with Jupiter, which may keep its subsurface ocean in a liquid state. The moon's potential for harboring life has made it a focus of future space missions.",
        callisto: "Callisto, the second-largest moon of Jupiter, is heavily cratered and is considered the most heavily cratered object in the solar system. Its surface is ancient and has not been significantly altered by geological processes for billions of years. Callisto has a thin atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide. The moon’s low radiation levels compared to other Jovian moons make it an attractive target for human exploration.",
        io: "Io, the most volcanically active body in the solar system, has hundreds of volcanoes that constantly reshape its surface. Its intense volcanic activity is caused by tidal heating from its gravitational interactions with Jupiter and other moons. Io's surface is dotted with sulfur and sulfur dioxide, giving it a colorful appearance. The constant volcanic eruptions release plumes that can reach hundreds of miles into space.",
        ganymede: "Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even larger than the planet Mercury. It has its own magnetic field, a unique feature among moons, and a surface composed of a mix of ice and rock. Ganymede may have a subsurface ocean, making it another candidate in the search for extraterrestrial life. Its surface features a mix of older, heavily cratered regions and younger, tectonically reshaped areas.",
        titan: "Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, has a thick atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen, with lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane on its surface. Its dense atmosphere and surface liquid make it one of the most Earth-like bodies in the solar system, though much colder. Titan’s surface is hidden beneath a thick orange haze, but radar and infrared imaging have revealed a diverse landscape. The moon's complex organic chemistry is of great interest to scientists studying the building blocks of life.",
